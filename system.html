        <h2>Types of Climate</h2>
        <p>The Earth experiences a wide variety of climates, each with unique characteristics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Tropical Climate:</b> Found near the equator, characterized by high temperatures and heavy rainfall throughout the year. Example: Amazon Rainforest.</li>
            <li><b>Desert Climate:</b> Extremely dry with very little precipitation. Examples: Sahara Desert and Arabian Desert.</li>
            <li><b>Temperate Climate:</b> Mild weather with four distinct seasons. Example: Mediterranean regions like Southern California and parts of Europe.</li>
            <li><b>Polar Climate:</b> Cold climates with snow and ice, found at the poles. Example: Antarctica and the Arctic.</li>
            <li><b>Mountain Climate:</b> Found in high altitudes with cold temperatures and significant snowfall. Example: The Himalayas.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Climate Change</h2>
        <p>Climate change refers to long-term changes in temperature, precipitation patterns, and other atmospheric conditions. The Earth's climate is warming due to human activities like deforestation, burning of fossil fuels, and industrial processes.</p>
        
        <h3>Effects of Climate Change:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Rising Sea Levels:</b> Melting glaciers and ice sheets are causing the oceans to rise, threatening coastal cities.</li>
            <li><b>Extreme Weather Events:</b> Increased frequency of hurricanes, droughts, heatwaves, and flooding.</li>
            <li><b>Loss of Biodiversity:</b> Many species are unable to adapt to rapidly changing climates, leading to extinction.</li>
            <li><b>Impact on Agriculture:</b> Changing weather patterns are affecting crop production and food security worldwide.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Why Is Climate Change Happening?</h3>
        <p>The primary cause of current climate change is human activity, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) for energy.</li>
            <li>Deforestation and land use changes that increase the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</li>
            <li>Industrial agriculture and livestock farming, contributing to greenhouse gases like methane.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Global Warming</h2>
        <p>Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earthâ€™s average surface temperature due to human activities. It is primarily caused by the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which trap heat and prevent it from escaping into space.</p>
        
        <h3>Greenhouse Gases:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Carbon Dioxide (CO2):</b> Emitted by burning fossil fuels.</li>
            <li><b>Methane (CH4):</b> Released by livestock and the decay of organic waste in landfills.</li>
            <li><b>Nitrous Oxide (N2O):</b> Emitted by agricultural and industrial activities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Consequences of Global Warming:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Melting of polar ice caps and glaciers.</li>
            <li>More frequent and intense heatwaves.</li>
            <li>Disruption of ecosystems and weather patterns.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Solutions to Combat Climate Change</h2>
        <p>Several actions can be taken to mitigate climate change and reduce its impact:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Reduce Carbon Emissions:</b> Transition to renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power.</li>
            <li><b>Reforestation:</b> Plant trees to absorb carbon dioxide and restore ecosystems.</li>
            <li><b>Energy Efficiency:</b> Improve energy efficiency in buildings, transportation, and industries.</li>
            <li><b>Climate Education:</b> Raise awareness about the importance of sustainable practices and encourage individuals to adopt eco-friendly habits.</li>
        </ul>
